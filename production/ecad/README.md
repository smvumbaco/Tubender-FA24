This is where all KiCAD stuff is stored

To make development and merging easier, a hierarchical design is suggested for schematics. This enables engineers to work on different sections of the schematicand minimize the amount of conflicts received.

`components` directory contains components utilized in this system

Please utilize whatever KiCAD version is requested by the lead. If you aren't sure which version, please ask your lead.

! Remember to only commit the `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb`, and `.kicad_pro` to this repository, everything else isn't needed to reconstruct the schematic on any KiCAD enabled machine
